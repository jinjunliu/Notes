This page will cover the SQL statement fundamentals.

## Overview of the Challenges

The basis of these challenge scenarios will be that you've just been hired as a SQL consultant for a DVD rental store.

## SQL cheat sheet

The following is a cheat sheet for SQL statements.

## SQL Statement Fundamentals

This section focuses on SQL syntax.

### SELECT

`SELECT` is used to retrieve data from a database. The basic syntax is:

```sql
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name;
```

To select multiple columns, use a comma to separate them. To select all columns, use `*`, i.e., `SELECT * FROM table_name;`. In general it is not good practice to use an asterisk (*) in the SELECT statement if you don’t really need all columns. It will automatically query everything, which increases traffic between the database server and the application, which can slow down the retrieval of results.

SQL statements are not case sensitive, but we generally use upper case for the keyword. A database can contain multiple tables, so we need to specify which table we want to retrieve data from.

In PgAdmin, you can check the tables by clicking the database, then clicking `Schemas`, then clicking `Tables`. Some practices for `SELECT` statements in PgAdmin to query the `dvdrental` database:

```sql
SELECT * FROM actor; -- SELECT all columns from actor table
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM actor; -- SELECT first_name and last_name columns from actor table
```

**Challenge**: We want to send out a promotional email to our existing customers. Use a `SELECT` statement to grab the first and last names of every customer and their email address.

{{< hint info >}}

**Hint**: 
* Use the customer table
* You can use the table drop-down to view what columns are available
* You could also use SELECT * FROM customer to see all the columns.

{{< /hint >}}

My solution:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, email FROM customer;
```

### SELECT DISTINCT

`SELECT DISTINCT` is used to retrieve data from a database, but only once for each unique value in the column. The basic syntax is:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column_name(s) FROM table_name;
```

To clarify which column DISTINCT is being applied to, you can also use parenthesis for clarity:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT (column_name) FROM table_name;
```

It will work with or without parenthesis. Later on when we learn about adding more calls such as `COUNT` and `DISTINCT` together, the parenthesis will be necessary.

**Challenge**: An Australian visitor isn’t familiar with MPAA movie ratings (e.g. PG , PG-13, R, etc…). We want to know the types of ratings we have in our database. What ratings do we have available? Use what you’ve learned about `SELECT DISTINCT` to retrieve the distinct rating types our films could have in our database.

{{< hint info >}}

**Hint**:

* Use the film table
* Use SELECT * FROM film; to see what columns are available.
* Or use drop down table menu in pgadmin.

{{< /hint >}}

Solution:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT rating FROM film;
```

### COUNT

The `COUNT` function returns the number of input rows that match a specific condition of a query. We can apply COUNT on a specific column or just pass COUNT(*) , we will soon see this should return the same result. The basic syntax is:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name;
```

This is simply returning the number of rows in the table. In fact, it should be the same regardless of the column. Because of this COUNT by itself simply returns back a count of the number of rows in a table. COUNT is much more useful when combined with other commands, such as DISTINCT. For example,

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT rating) FROM film;
```

This will return the number of distinct ratings in our film table.

### SELECT WHERE

SELECT and WHERE are the most fundamental SQL statements and you will find yourself using them often! The WHERE statement allows us to specify conditions on columns for the rows to be returned. The basic syntax is:

```sql
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

The WHERE clause appears immediately after the FROM clause of the SELECT statement. The conditions are used to filter the rows returned from the SELECT statement. PostgreSQL provides a variety of standard operators to construct the conditions.

* Comparison Operators

The following table lists the comparison operators that are available in PostgreSQL.

| Operator | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| = | Equal to |
| !=, <> | Not equal to |
| > | Greater than |
| >= | Greater than or equal to |
| < | Less than |
| <= | Less than or equal to |
| LIKE | Like |
| NOT LIKE | Not like |
| IS | Is |
| IS NOT | Is not |

* Logical Operators

The following table lists the logical operators that are available in PostgreSQL.

| Operator | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| AND | Logical AND |
| OR | Logical OR |
| NOT | Logical NOT |
