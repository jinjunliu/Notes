This section discusses the operation of the Python standard library on files and directories. Python does not need to import any modules for operating files and directories.


## File basic operation

`open()` function is used to open a file and return a file object. `w` represents writing mode, `r` indicates reading mode, `a` indicates the append mode, `r+` represents the read and write mode. For example, write mode:

```python
f = open('test.txt', 'w')
f.write('Hello, world!')
f.close()
```

In this way, we successfully created a file called `test.txt`, and wrote a row `Hello, world!` at the beginning of the file.

Using the `r` mode, you will read the contents of the file:

```python
f = open('test.txt', 'r')
print(f.read())
f.close()
```

You can also use the `with` statement, it can automatically close the file:

```python
with open('test.txt', 'r') as f:
    print(f.read())
```

In `a` mode, if the file does not exist, it will create a new file, if the file exists, add content at the end of the file.

```python
with open('test.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write('add something')
```

At this time, the content in `test.txt` file is `Hello, world!add something`.

Use the `seek()` function to move the file pointer to the specified location, for example:

```python
with open('test.txt', 'r') as f:
    f.seek(5)
    print(f.read())
```

This is to move the file pointer to the 5th characters (the first character is the 0th character) and then read the contents thereof. The output is `, world!add something`.

## Create a temporary file and directory

This part needs to import `os` and `tempfile` module.

```python
import os
import tempfile
```

Get information about the temporary data environment:

```python
print(tempfile.gettempdir())
print(tempfile.gettempprefix())
```

The path to the temporary data environment will be output, such as `/tmp`, and prefix of the temporary file, such as `tmp`.

Create a temporary file using the `mkstemp()` function:

```python
(tempfh, tempfp) = tempfile.mkstemp(".tmp", "testTemp", None, True)
print(tempfp)
```

`mkstemp()` function returns a tuple, where the first element is a file descriptor, the second element is the file path. Its parameters are: file suffix, file name prefix, specified directory, whether the file is a text file.

Use the `os`'s `fdopen()` function to convert the file descriptor into a file object. Let's write the contents in the temporary file, then read, and print it out, and finally close the temporary file and delete the temporary file.

```python
f = os.fdopen(tempfh, "w+t")
f.write("Hello, world!")
f.seek(0)
print(f.read())
f.close()
os.remove(tempfp)
```

You can also create temporary files using the `TemporaryFile()` function:

```python
with tempfile.TemporaryFile() as f:
    f.write("Hello, world!")
    f.seek(0)
    print(f.read())
```

If there are a lot of temporary files that need to be created, you can use the `TemporaryDirectory()` function, which creates a temporary directory and deletes the directory when exiting.

```python
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdirname:
    print("created temporary directory", tmpdirname)
    path = os.path.join(tmpdirname, "test.txt")
    with open(path, "w") as f:
        f.write("Hello, world!")
    print("File contents:")
    with open(path, "r") as f:
        print(f.read())
```

## Read the CSV file

The CSV file is a text file, which is generally separated by a comma. We can read the CSV file using the `CSV` module. After importing the module, you can use the `reader()` function to read the CSV file, which returns an iterator, every iteration returns a list, each element in the list is a string, representing a line of data. Here is a simple example:

CSV文件的内容为：

```
"Month", "Average", "2005", "2006", "2007", "2008", "2009", "2010", "2011", "2012", "2013", "2014", "2015"
"May",  0.1,  0,  0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0,  0,  0  
"Jun",  0.5,  2,  1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2,  0,  1
"Jul",  0.7,  5,  1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 0, 2,  2,  1
"Aug",  2.3,  6,  3, 2, 4, 4, 4, 7, 8, 2,  2,  3
"Sep",  3.5,  6,  4, 7, 4, 2, 8, 5, 2, 5,  2,  5
"Oct",  2.0,  8,  0, 1, 3, 2, 5, 1, 5, 2,  3,  0
"Nov",  0.5,  3,  0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1,  0,  1
"Dec",  0.0,  1,  0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,  0,  1
```

The Python code to read the above CSV file is as follows:

```python
import csv
with open("data.csv", "r") as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```

The output is the content of the CSV file, and each line of data is a list.

We can use the `Sniffer` class to detect the format of the CSV file, and return a `Dialect` object, the object contains the format information of the CSV file.

```python
print(csv.list_dialects()) # Print all available formats
with open("data.csv", "r") as f:
    dialect = csv.Sniffer().sniff(f.read(1024))
    f.seek(0)
    hasHeader = csv.Sniffer().has_header(f.read(1024))
    f.seek(0)
    print("Headers found: " + str(hasHeader))
    print(dialect.delimiter)
    print(dialect.escapechar)
    print(dialect.quotechar)
```

The first line is to print all available formats, the output is: `['excel', 'excel-tab', 'unix']`. The second row begins to detect the format of the CSV file, `1024` means to read 1024 characters, the output result is:

```
0
0
Headers found: False
,
None
"
```

The latter three-line print is: Dilimiter, escape character, quote character.

## Write CSV file

We use the `writer()` function to write to the CSV file, the function returns a writer. You can use the `writerow()` function to write a line of data, `writerows()` function to write multi-line data. For example:

```python
with open("data.csv", mode="w") as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerow(["Month", "Average", "2005", "2006", "2007", "2008", "2009", "2010", "2011", "2012", "2013", "2014", "2015"])
    writer.writerow(["May",  0.1,  0,  0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0,  0,  0])
    writer.writerow(["Jun",  0.5,  2,  1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2,  0,  1])
    writer.writerow(["Jul",  0.7,  5,  1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 0, 2,  2,  1])
    writer.writerow(["Aug",  2.3,  6,  3, 2, 4, 4, 4, 7, 8, 2,  2,  3])
    writer.writerow(["Sep",  3.5,  6,  4, 7, 4, 2, 8, 5, 2, 5,  2,  5])
    writer.writerow(["Oct",  2.0,  8,  0, 1, 3, 2, 5, 1, 5, 2,  3,  0])
    writer.writerow(["Nov",  0.5,  3,  0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1,  0,  1])
    writer.writerow(["Dec",  0.0,  1,  0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,  0,  1])
```

## Handling ZIP files

Import the `zipfile` module and use the `zipfile` class to handle the ZIP file. Create a new Zip Archive and add the files `data.csv` to the Zip Archive:

```python
import zipfile
with zipfile.ZipFile("data.zip", "w") as f:
    f.write("data.csv")
```

Check if a zip archive is valid:

```python
print(zipfile.is_zipfile("data.zip"))
```

The output is: `True`, indicating that zip archive is valid.

Read the list of files for a ZIP Archive:

```python
with zipfile.ZipFile("data.zip", "r") as f:
    print(f.namelist())
```

The output result is: `['data.csv']`, indicating there is only one file `data.csv in the Zip Archive.

We can use the `getinfo()` function to get the file information in ZIP Archive:

```python
with zipfile.ZipFile("data.zip", "r") as f:
    info = f.getinfo("data.csv")
    print(info.file_size)
    print(info.compress_size)
    print(info.compress_type)
```

The output result is:

```
327
327
0
```

Print the file content:

```python
with zipfile.ZipFile("data.zip", "r") as f:
    with f.open("data.csv") as f2:
        print(f2.read())
```

We can extract files in Zip Archive:

```python
with zipfile.ZipFile("data.zip", "r") as f:
    f.extractall()
```

## Configuration file

Configuration File is a file for storing configuration information of the program so that we do not have to write a configuration information such as parameters in the program (this is called "hard code"). For example, the configuration file can be as follows:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
name = "John Doe" # Parameter name = parameter value
age = 30

[database]
host = localhost
port = 3306
user = root
password = 123456
database = mydb
```

We can use the `configparser` module to read the configuration file. First create a `ConfigParser` object, then use the `read()` function to read the configuration file:

```python
import configparser
parser = configparser.ConfigParser()
parser.read("config.ini")
print(parser.sections()) # Output all sections
print(parser.has_section("database")) # Check if there is section Database
print(parser.get("DEFAULT", "name")) # Output Name in Default Section
print(parser.get("database", "port")) # Output port in Database Section
print(parser["database"]["host"]) # Output Host in Database Section, Parser can be seen as a dictionary 
```

The output results are: `"database"`，`True`，`"John Doe"`和`"3306"`. DEFAULT Section will be ignored when all Section is output. It is worth noting that the value thus acquired is a string, such as `"3306"`, if you need to get a number, you need to use the `int()` function. But using the `parser.getint()` function can get the value directly.

```python
print(type(parser["database"].getint("port"))) # output <class 'int'>
```

Similarly, `parser.getfloat()` and `parser.getboolean()` function can be used to get floating point values and boolean values.

If you try to get a section that does not exist, it will throw the `KeyError` Exception:

```python
try:
    print(parser["database2"]["port"])
except KeyError as err:
    print("No such section: " + str(err))
```

The output will be: `No such section: database2`.
