Intergrated Develepment Environment (IDE) is a set of tools that help you to develop and debug your Python code. IDEs can perform syntax checking, auto-completion, auto-formatting, and other functions. I would recommend using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for Python development.

## PyCharm

Pycharm is developed by JetBrains. You can download it from [JetBrains official website](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/). Pycharm has two versions, Professional Edition and Community Edition. The first one supports more features, but it is not free. The second one has less features, but it is free. For students and teachers, the Professional Edition is free, so if you have an edu email, you can apply for a free license at [this page](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/). Pycharm's tutorial can be found at [Pycharm's official website](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/quick-start-guide.html#).

## VS Code

If we say that Pycharm is good for large projects, then VS Code is better for smaller projects. VS Code is developed by Microsoft. It is free and open source. You can download it from [Microsoft official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). To support the develepment process, we can install some plugins, such as `Python`, `Pylance`, `Python Docstring Generator` etc in VS Code's extension page. [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) is a strongly recommended plugin. It is a AI assistant that helps you to write code. You should try it out.
