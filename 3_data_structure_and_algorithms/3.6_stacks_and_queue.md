## Stack: Introduction

Stacks are a data structure that are similar to lists. The difference is that they are FILO (first in last out). A simple real-world example of a stack would be a can of tennis balls. If you put balls numbered 1, 2, and 3 in that order into a tennis ball can. they can only be removed in the order 3, 2, 1. (See [reference](http://mathcenter.oxford.emory.edu/site/cs171/stacks/)).

## Stack: Constructor

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
        

class Stack:
    def __init__(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        self.top = new_node
        self.height = 1

    def print_stack(self):
        temp = self.top
        while temp is not None:
            print(temp.value)
            temp = temp.next

my_stack = Stack(4)

my_stack.print_stack()
```

## Queue: Introduction

Queues are FIFO (first in first out).
