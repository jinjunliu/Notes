## Functional Programming in Java

Here are some topics covered in this lesson:

- Comparing and contrasting imperative and functional programming styles, and understanding when one style might be preferrable over the other.
- Using functional interfaces and lambdas to create shorter, easier-to-read Java code.
- Using the Stream API to process data and aggregate the results into Java collections.

### Big Picture & Intuition

**Imperative Code**

Early Java programs were usually programmed in the imperative style. Imperative code usually focuses on how a task is performed. Each line of code gives a specific procedure or operation:

```java
int getTopScore(List<Student> students) {
 int topScore = 0;
 for (Student s : students) {
   if (s == null) continue;
   topScore = Math.max(topScore, s.getScore());
 }
 return topScore;
}
```

- Focuses on how a task is performed.
- Each line of code gives a specific procedure or operation.

**Question 1/2**

Which of these are elements of imperative programs? (A, C)

- `for` loops and `while` loops
- lambda expressions
- Individual steps about how a task is performed
- Streams

**Functional Code**

Starting with version 8, Java added language features to support a more functional style of programming. You might also hear some people call it declarative programming.

Functional code focuses on what happens to inputs in order to produce outputs. You can think of it as describing how to get from the input to the output:

```java
int getTopScore(List<Student> students) {
 return students.stream()
     .filter(Objects::nonNull)
     .mapToInt(Student::getScore)
     .max()
     .orElse(0);
}
```

This code does the exact same thing as the last code example, but it uses a more functional programming style, because it:

- Focuses on what happens to inputs in order to produce outputs..
- Describes how to transform the input into the output.

**Question 2/2**

Which of these are elements of functional programming in Java? (A, B, C)

- Lambda expressions
- Streams
- step-by-step transformation of what ishappenning to inputs
- `for` loops and `while` loops

**Functional vs Imperative Code**

- There is nothing wrong with either imperative or functional styles of programming.
- Anything you can do with one, you can do with the other.
- Whether to use one or the other often boils down to your specific scenario, and your personal preference as a programmer.

### Using Lambda Expressions

**Lambda Expressions**

`Lambdas` are a Java language feature that make it very easy to implement certain kinds of interfaces in Java. When you compare lambda expressions to the traditional way to of implementing a Java interface, lambdas usually result in much cleaner and easier to understand code.

**Code demo**

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.function.Predicate;

public final class LambdasMain {

  /**
   * Returns the number of strings that match a given condition.
   *
   * @param input the strings that should be tested.
   * @param condition the condition that strings should be tested against.
   * @return the number of strings in the input that match the condition.
   */
  public static long countMatchingStrings(List<String> input, Predicate<String> condition) {
    return input.stream().filter(condition).count();
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    List<String> input = List.of("hello", "\t   ", "world", "", "\t", " ", "goodbye", "  ");

    long numberOfWhitespaceStrings =
            countMatchingStrings(input, s -> s.trim().isEmpty());

    System.out.println(numberOfWhitespaceStrings + " whitespace strings");
  }
}
```

```java
BinaryOperator<Integer> add =
   (Integer a, Integer b) -> { return a + b; };

System.out.println(add.apply(1, 2));
```

As you saw from the demo, you can use lambdas to greatly shorten you code and make it easier to read.

**Question 1/2**

Which parts of the lambda expression syntax are optional? (A, B, D, E)

- The `return` statement
- The parameter types
- The `->` arrow
- The `(...)` parentheses (when there is justone parameter)
- The `{}` curly braces, for single-statement lambdas

**Question 2/2**

Which of the following are valid lambda expressions? (A, B, C, D)

- (Double x, int y) -> { return x * y; }
- (x, y) -> x * y
- x -> x * x
- () -> () -> 10
- {x, y} -> (x + y)
- (Double x, Double y) -> {x * y}


{{< hint info >}}
Java can infer the parameter types.

If the right side of the lambda is a result of a one-liner operation the curly braces can be removed.

If there's only one argument on the left side of the lambda, the parentheses are optional.

When there are no arguments on the left side of the lambda expression we can use a pair of empty parentheses `()`. Lambdas are also allowed to return other lambdas.

When using curly braces to delimit a block of code on the right side of the lambda, the `return` keyword is required.

Curly braces cannot be used on the left side of the lambda.

**Key Terms**

- `Lambda expression`: An expression that can be used to succinctly implement certain interfaces in Java.

### Functional Interfaces

In this section, you will learn to:

- Define what lambda functions and functional interfaces are.
- Identify when lambda functions and functional interfaces can be used.

**Functional Interfaces**

In the previous section, I mentioned that only certain kinds of interfaces can be implemented by lambdas. Those interfaces are called `functional interfaces`.

A functional interface is a Java interface with exactly one abstract method, called the functional method.

**Example**

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Predicate<T> {
  boolean test(T t);
  default Predicate<T> negate() { return (t) -> !test(t); }

  // Other methods left out of this example
}
```

The `Predicate` interface from the demo you saw earlier was a functional interface.

Notice that functional interfaces are Java interfaces, and just like a non-functional Java interface, they are allowed to have type parameters. Here, Predicate has one type parameter T, which is the type being tested.

`Predicate`'s one abstract method is `test()`. `test()` is known as the functional method. "Abstract" means the method is not implemented, so in order to be a functional method, it cannot have a default implementation. However, functional interfaces *can* have other default methods. In this case, the `Predicate` interface has a default method called `negate()` that returns another `Predicate`.

The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation at the top serves two important purposes:

- If that annotation is added to any interface that is not a valid functional interface, the Java compiler will report a compilation error.
- It tells whoever is reading the code that this is interface is designed to be used with lambdas.

That's why if you intend for an interface to be functional, you should always add the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation.

When you're designing a Java interface, you should consider making it a functional interface if it describes a single operation.

**Quiz Question**

Which of these statements are true? (A, C, D)

- A functional interface is an interface with exactly one abstract method.
- A functional interface is an abstract class with several abstract methods.
- A functional interface can be inplemented by a lambda expression.
- The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation can help detect errors.

### Quizzes: Functional Interfaces

**QUESTION 1 OF 6**

Why should you use the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation when writing your own functional interfaces? (A, C)

- It will cause a compilation error if the annotated interface is not a valid functional interface.
- The Java compiler requires functional interfaces to have that annotation.
- It tells users of your interface that the interface is intended to be targeted by lambdas.
- It allows the Java runtime to optimize lambdas that implement the functional interface. 

{{< hint info >}}
Right! @FunctionalInterface signals that the interface can be targeted by lambdas, and it also causes the Java compiler to make sure it's actually a valid functional interface.
{{< /hint >}}

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Function<T, R> {
    static <T> Function<T, T> identity() {
        return t -> t;
    }

    R apply(T t);

    default <V> Function<V, R> compose(Function<? super V, ? extends T> before) {
        Objects.requireNonNull(before);
        return (V v) -> apply(before.apply(v));
    }

    default <V> Function<T, V> andThen(Function<? super R, ? extends V> after) {
        Objects.requireNonNull(after);
        return (T t) -> after.apply(apply(t));
    }
}
```

**QUESTION 2 OF 6**

What is the functional method of the `Function` interface above? (B)

- identity
- apply
- compose
- andThen

{{< hint info >}}
Correct! apply is the only abstract method in the Function interface.
{{< /hint >}}


```java
abstract class Printable {
  abstract void print(String prefix);
}
```

**QUESTION 3 OF 6**

Is `Printable` a functional interface? (No)

{{< hint info >}}
Right! `Printable` is not a functional interface because it is a class.
{{< /hint >}}

```java
interface Squareable {
  default int square(int a) {
    return a * a;
  }
}
```

**QUESTION 4 OF 6**

Is `Squareable` a functional interface? (No)

{{< hint info >}}
Correct! Functional interfaces must have exactly one abstract method. If a method has a `default` implementation, it's not abstract.
{{< /hint >}}

```java
public interface BiFunction<T, U, R> {
  R apply(T t, U u);
}
```

**QUESTION 5 OF 6**

Is `BiFunction` a functional interface? (Yes)

{{< hint info >}}

Correct! Functional interfaces are allowed to have type parameters, and the function method (`apply` in this case) can take any number of parameters.

{{< /hint >}}

```java
interface ConvertibleToString {
  @Override
  String toString();
}
```

**QUESTION 6 OF 6**

Is `ConvertibleToString` a functional interface? (No)

{{< hint info >}}
Right, remember that `java.lang.Object` methods, such as `toString()`, `equals()`, and `hashCode()` are not allowed to be the functional method.
{{< /hint >}}


### Exercise: defining a functional interface

**Binary Operations**

In this exercise, you will define a functional interface that represents a binary operation between two integers.

> **Binary operation** is a fancy term that refers to a method that takes two arguments.

In this case, your functional method should take two `int` arguments, and it should return an `int` result.

1. First, create an interface called BinaryOperation and put it in its own file. The interface should contain one abstract method, `apply()`, which takes two `int` arguments and returns an `int`.

2. Next, annotate the interface with `@FunctionalInterface`. If you structured the functional interface correctly, the Java compiler will allow it.

3. Then, make sure `Main.java` compiles:

```bash
javac Main.java
```

If you chose a name other than "BinaryOperation" for the functional interface, you will have to edit the code in the `main()` method to refer to your functional interface.

4. Finally, run the program:

```bash
java -ea Main
```

*Note:* The `-ea` flag stands for "enable assertions". It's useful here because `Main.java` has an `assert` statement in it.

### Solution: Defining a functional interface

**BinaryOperation.java**

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface BinaryOperation {
  int apply(int a, int b);
}
```

**Main.java**

```java
public final class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    BinaryOperation add = (a, b) -> a + b;
    // Or you could use:
    //
    //  BinaryOperation add = Integer::sum;
    //
    // More on method references later!

    assert 5 == add.apply(2, 3);
  }
}
```

**Alternative Solution**

If you were paying really close attention, you may have noticed you can avoid creating a custom functional interface altogether — just use `java.util.function.BinaryOperator` with a type parameter of `Integer`! Then your `Main.java` method would look like this:

```java
public final class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    BinaryOperator<Integer> add = (a, b) -> a + b;
    assert 5 == add.apply(2, 3);
  }
}
```

Take a moment to look at some of the other predefined functional interfaces in Java's built-in `java.util.function` package. It might save you some work in the future!
