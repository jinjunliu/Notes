## Stack: Introduction

Stacks are a data structure that are similar to lists. The difference is that they are FILO (first in last out). A simple real-world example of a stack would be a can of tennis balls. If you put balls numbered 1, 2, and 3 in that order into a tennis ball can. they can only be removed in the order 3, 2, 1. (See [reference](http://mathcenter.oxford.emory.edu/site/cs171/stacks/)). Stacks have method called `push` and `pop`.

## Stack: Constructor

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None

class Stack:
    def __init__(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        self.top = new_node
        self.height = 1

    def print_stack(self):
        temp = self.top
        while temp is not None:
            print(temp.value)
            temp = temp.next

my_stack = Stack(4)

my_stack.print_stack()
```

## Stack: Push

```python
    def push(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        if self.height == 0:
            self.top = new_node
        else:
            new_node.next = self.top
            self.top = new_node
        self.height += 1
```

## Stack: Pop

```python
    def pop(self):
        if self.height == 0:
            return None
        temp = self.top
        self.top = self.top.next
        temp.next = None
        self.height -= 1
        return temp
```

## Queue: Introduction

Queues are FIFO (first in first out). A simple real-world example of a queue would be a line of people waiting to get in a bus. If you put people in the line in the order 1, 2, and 3, they can only be removed in the order 1, 2, and 3. (See [reference](http://mathcenter.oxford.emory.edu/site/cs171/queues/)). Queues have method called `enqueue` and `dequeue`.


## Queue: Constructor

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
        
class Queue:
    def __init__(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        self.first = new_node
        self.last = new_node
        self.length = 1

    def print_queue(self):
        temp = self.first
        while temp is not None:
            print(temp.value)
            temp = temp.next

my_queue = Queue(4)

my_queue.print_queue()
```

## Queue: Enqueue

```python
    def enqueue(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        if self.first is None:
            self.first = new_node
            self.last = new_node
        else:
            self.last.next = new_node
            self.last = new_node
        self.length += 1
```

## Queue: Dequeue

```python
    def dequeue(self):
        if self.length == 0:
            return None
        temp = self.first
        if self.length == 1:
            self.first = None
            self.last = None
        else:
            self.first = self.first.next
            temp.next = None
        self.length -= 1
        return temp
```
