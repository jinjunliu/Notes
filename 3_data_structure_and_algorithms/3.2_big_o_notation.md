## Introduction

Big O notation is a mathematical notation for describing the complexity of an algorithm. Time and space complexity are two things we care about when it comes to designing algorithms.

## Worst Case

$Omega(n)$ is the best case complexity of an algorithm. $theta(n)$ is the average case complexity of an algorithm. $Omicron(n)$ is the worst case complexity of an algorithm.

## O(n)

The following algorithms are O(n):

```python
def print_items(n):
    for i in range(n):
        print(i)

print_items(10)
```

## Drop Constant

The constant can be dropped from the expression. For example, $O(2n)$ can be rewritten as $O(n)$.

```python
def print_items(n):
    for i in range(n):
        print(i)

    for j in range(n):
        print(j)

print_items(10)
```
