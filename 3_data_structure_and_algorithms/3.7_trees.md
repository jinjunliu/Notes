## Trees: Introduction & Terminology

A node of a tree is a single element of a tree. A tree is a collection of nodes. A node of a binary tree has a value and two pointers: left and right. A node of a non-binary tree has a value and any number of pointers.

Full: A tree is full if every node has exactly two children.

Perfect: A tree is perfect if every node has two children.

Complete: A tree is complete if we fill the tree from left to right with no gaps.
