## Introduction

Big O notation is a mathematical notation for describing the complexity of an algorithm. Time and space complexity are two things we care about when it comes to designing algorithms.

## Worst Case

{{< katex >}}
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty\hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}\,d\xi
{{< /katex >}}

is the best case complexity of an algorithm. $theta(n)$ is the average case complexity of an algorithm. $Omicron(n)$ is the worst case complexity of an algorithm.

## O(n)

The time complexity of the following code is O(n).

```python
def print_items(n):
    for i in range(n):
        print(i)

print_items(10)
```

## Drop Constant

The constant can be dropped from the expression. For example, O(2n) can be rewritten as O(n).

```python
def print_items(n):
    for i in range(n):
        print(i)

    for j in range(n):
        print(j)

print_items(10)
```

## O(n^2)

The time complexity of the following code is O(n^2).

```python
def print_items(n):
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            print(i,j) 

print_items(10)
```

The following code runs for O(n^3) time.

```python
def print_items(n):
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            for k in range(n):
                print(i,j,k)

print_items(10)
```

O(n^3) (and so on) can be simplified to O(n^2).

## Drop non-dominants

The time complexity of the following code is O(n^2 + n).

```python
def print_items(n):
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            print(i,j)
    for k in range(n):
        print(k)

print_items(10)
```

We can drop the non-dominant term n, therefore the time complexity is O(n^2).

## O(1)

O(1) means the time complexity is constant, i.e., no matter how large the input size is, the time complexity is always the same.

```python
def add_items(n):
    return n + n + n

print add_items(10)
```

## O(log n)

Binary search is an example of an algorithm that has time complexity of O(log n).

## Different Terms for Inputs

```python
def print_items(a,b):
    for i in range(a):
        print(i)

    for j in range(b):
        print(j)

print_items(1, 10)
```

The above function has two parameters, a and b, and the time complexity is O(a + b). It can not be simplified to O(a) or O(b).

## Lists

* O(1): my_list.append(item), my_list.pop(), my_list.lookup(index)
* O(n): my_list.pop(n), my_list.insert(n, item), my_list.remove(item), my_list.lookup(item) (because the list needs to be reindexed)
