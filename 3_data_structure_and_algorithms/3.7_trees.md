## Trees: Introduction & Terminology

A node of a tree is a single element of a tree. A tree is a collection of nodes. A node of a binary tree has a value and two pointers: left and right. A node of a non-binary tree has a value and any number of pointers.

Full: A Full Binary Tree (FBT) is a tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children.

Perfect: A Perfect Binary Tree (PBT) is a tree with all leaf nodes at the same depth. All internal nodes have degree 2.

Complete: A Complete Binary Treeï¼ˆCBT) is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
