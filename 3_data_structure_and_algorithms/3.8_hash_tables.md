## Hash Tables: Introduction

In computing, a hash table (hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. During lookup, the key is hashed and the resulting hash indicates where the corresponding value is stored (Source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table)). A simple real-world example of a hash table would be a dictionary. (See [reference](http://mathcenter.oxford.emory.edu/site/cs171/hashTables/)).

Hash functions are used to convert a string into a number. The number is used to index into a hash table. Hash functions are 

**one way**: we can convert a string into a number, but we can't convert a number back into a string.

**deterministic**: the same string will always have the same number.

`Dictionary` is Python built-in hash table.
