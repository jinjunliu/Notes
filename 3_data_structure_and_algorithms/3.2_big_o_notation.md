## Introduction

Big O notation is a mathematical notation for describing the complexity of an algorithm. Time and space complexity are two things we care about when it comes to designing algorithms.

## Worst Case

$$\Omega(n)$$ is the best case complexity of an algorithm. $$\theta(n)$$ is the average case complexity of an algorithm. $$\Omicron(n)$$ is the worst case complexity of an algorithm.

## O(n)

The time complexity of the following code is $$\Omicron(n)$$.

```python
def print_items(n):
    for i in range(n):
        print(i)

print_items(10)
```

## Drop Constant

The constant can be dropped from the expression. For example, $$\Omicron(2n)$$ can be rewritten as $$\Omicron(n)$$.

```python
def print_items(n):
    for i in range(n):
        print(i)

    for j in range(n):
        print(j)

print_items(10)
```

## O(n^2)

The time complexity of the following code is $$\Omicron(n^2)$$.

```python
def print_items(n):
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            print(i,j) 

print_items(10)
```

The following code runs for $$\Omicron(n^3)$$ time.

```python
def print_items(n):
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            for k in range(n):
                print(i,j,k)

print_items(10)
```

$$\Omicron(n^3)$$ (and so on) can be simplified to $$\Omicron(n^2)$$.

## Drop non-dominants

The time complexity of the following code is $$\Omicron(n^2+n)$$.

```python
def print_items(n):
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            print(i,j)
    for k in range(n):
        print(k)

print_items(10)
```

We can drop the non-dominant term n, therefore the time complexity is $$\Omicron(n^2)$$.

## O(1)

$$\Omicron(1)$$ means the time complexity is constant, i.e., no matter how large the input size is, the time complexity is always the same.

```python
def add_items(n):
    return n + n + n

print add_items(10)
```

## O(log n)

Binary search is an example of an algorithm that has time complexity of $$\Omicron(\log n)$$.

## Different Terms for Inputs

```python
def print_items(a,b):
    for i in range(a):
        print(i)

    for j in range(b):
        print(j)

print_items(1, 10)
```

The above function has two parameters, a and b, and the time complexity is $$\Omicron(a+b)$$. It can not be simplified to $$\Omicron(a)$$ or $$\Omicron(b)$$.

## Lists

* $$\Omicron(1)$$: my_list.append(item), my_list.pop(), my_list.lookup(index)
* $$\Omicron(n)$$: my_list.pop(n), my_list.insert(n, item), my_list.remove(item), my_list.lookup(item) (because the list needs to be reindexed)
