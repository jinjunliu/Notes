## Parts and Pieces

Setting up Hadoop development environment can be broken down into the following parts:

* Choose Hadoop binaries or vendor distributio
* Choose Hadoop version
* Which location you want to put your Hadoop cluster or server in
    * Local install (free but takes a long time)
    * Local VM (must install virtualization software)
    * Cloud (costs money to test!)

We have several options for setting up Hadoop data storage.

* Local
    * File system (single)
    * HDFS (pseudo or distributed)
* Cloud
    * Cloud files (S3, BLOB)
    * HDFS

To set up Hadoop libraries, we need to set up:

* MapReduce (version 1.0 or 2.0)
* Other libraries
* Developer tools

## Local Cloudera

Cloudera Hadoop virtual machine:

* OS + virtualization software
* Hadoop virtual machine for that type of VM
* Cloudera tools and samples
* Install developer tools

Cloudera's open source software distribution including Apache Hadoop and additional key open source projects can be downloaded [here](https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/cdh.html)
