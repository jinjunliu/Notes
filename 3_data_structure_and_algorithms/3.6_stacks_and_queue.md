## Stack: Introduction

Stacks are a data structure that are similar to lists. The difference is that they are FILO (first in last out). A simple real-world example of a stack would be a can of tennis balls. If you put balls numbered 1, 2, and 3 in that order into a tennis ball can. they can only be removed in the order 3, 2, 1.
