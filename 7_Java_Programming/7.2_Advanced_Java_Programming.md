### Project: Parallel Web Crawler

Here's some info about the project you will complete at the end of the course.

UdaciSearch is interested in figuring out popular search terms on the internet in order to improve the SEO of their clients.

You are given the source code for your company's legacy web crawler, which is single-threaded. You notice it's a bit slow, and you quickly realize a way to improve its performance and impress your new manager.

## Functional Programming in Java

Here are some topics covered in this lesson:

- Comparing and contrasting imperative and functional programming styles, and understanding when one style might be preferrable over the other.
- Using functional interfaces and lambdas to create shorter, easier-to-read Java code.
- Using the Stream API to process data and aggregate the results into Java collections.

### Big Picture & Intuition

**Imperative Code**

Early Java programs were usually programmed in the imperative style. Imperative code usually focuses on how a task is performed. Each line of code gives a specific procedure or operation:

```java
int getTopScore(List<Student> students) {
 int topScore = 0;
 for (Student s : students) {
   if (s == null) continue;
   topScore = Math.max(topScore, s.getScore());
 }
 return topScore;
}
```

- Focuses on how a task is performed.
- Each line of code gives a specific procedure or operation.

**Question 1/2**

Which of these are elements of imperative programs? (A, C)

    - `for` loops and `while` loops
    - lambda expressions
    - Individual steps about how a task is performed
    - Streams

**Functional Code**

Starting with version 8, Java added language features to support a more functional style of programming. You might also hear some people call it declarative programming.

Functional code focuses on what happens to inputs in order to produce outputs. You can think of it as describing how to get from the input to the output:

```java
int getTopScore(List<Student> students) {
 return students.stream()
     .filter(Objects::nonNull)
     .mapToInt(Student::getScore)
     .max()
     .orElse(0);
}
```

This code does the exact same thing as the last code example, but it uses a more functional programming style, because it:

- Focuses on what happens to inputs in order to produce outputs..
- Describes how to transform the input into the output.

**Question 2/2**

Which of these are elements of functional programming in Java? (A, B, C)

    - Lambda expressions
    - Streams
    - step-by-step transformation of what is happenning to inputs
    - `for` loops and `while` loops

**Functional vs Imperative Code**

- There is nothing wrong with either imperative or functional styles of programming.
- Anything you can do with one, you can do with the other.
- Whether to use one or the other often boils down to your specific scenario, and your personal preference as a programmer.

### Using Lambda Expressions

**Lambda Expressions**

`Lambdas` are a Java language feature that make it very easy to implement certain kinds of interfaces in Java. When you compare lambda expressions to the traditional way to of implementing a Java interface, lambdas usually result in much cleaner and easier to understand code.

**Code demo**

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.function.Predicate;

public final class LambdasMain {

  /**
   * Returns the number of strings that match a given condition.
   *
   * @param input the strings that should be tested.
   * @param condition the condition that strings should be tested against.
   * @return the number of strings in the input that match the condition.
   */
  public static long countMatchingStrings(List<String> input, Predicate<String> condition) {
    return input.stream().filter(condition).count();
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    List<String> input = List.of("hello", "\t   ", "world", "", "\t", " ", "goodbye", "  ");

    long numberOfWhitespaceStrings =
            countMatchingStrings(input, s -> s.trim().isEmpty());

    System.out.println(numberOfWhitespaceStrings + " whitespace strings");
  }
}
```

```java
BinaryOperator<Integer> add =
   (Integer a, Integer b) -> { return a + b; };

System.out.println(add.apply(1, 2));
```

As you saw from the demo, you can use lambdas to greatly shorten you code and make it easier to read.

**Question 1/2**

Which parts of the lambda expression syntax are optional? (A, B, D, E)

    - The `return` statement
    - The parameter types
    - The `->` arrow
    - The `(...)` parentheses (when there is just one parameter)
    - The `{}` curly braces, for single-statement lambdas

**Question 2/2**

Which of the following are valid lambda expressions?

    - (Double x, int y) -> { return x * y; }
    - (x, y) -> x * y
    - x -> x * x
    - () -> () -> 10
    - {x, y} -> (x + y)
    - (Double x, Double y) -> {x * y}


{{< hint info >}}
Java can infer the parameter types.

If the right side of the lambda is a result of a one-liner operation the curly braces can be removed.

If there's only one argument on the left side of the lambda, the parentheses are optional.

When there are no arguments on the left side of the lambda expression we can use a pair of empty parentheses `()`. Lambdas are also allowed to return other lambdas.

When using curly braces to delimit a block of code on the right side of the lambda, the `return` keyword is required.

Curly braces cannot be used on the left side of the lambda.

**Key Terms**

- `Lambda expression`: An expression that can be used to succinctly implement certain interfaces in Java.
