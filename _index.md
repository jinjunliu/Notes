## About this site

This website is my personal notes. It is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator. The theme is [Hugo-book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book/). Static files are hosted on [Oracle Cloud](https://cloud.oracle.com/) with Nginx. See [my this blog](https://blog.jinjunliu.com/post/2021-07-13_nginx_host_website/) (in Chinese) for more details.
