## Introduction

Linked lists are a data structure that are used to store a sequence of data. They are used to store data in a linear fashion. The data is stored in nodes, which are connected to each other. The first node is called the head and the last node is called the tail. The head and tail are not connected to each other. The head is connected to the first node and the tail is connected to the last node.
