## Tree Traversal: Introduction

The idea of tree traversal is to visit each node of a tree in a certain order. The order can be pre-order, in-order, or post-order. The time complexity of tree traversal is O(n). The space complexity is O(n). The tree traversal is a recursive algorithm. The base case is when the tree is empty.

## BFS: Introduction

Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Extra memory, usually a queue, is needed to keep track of the child nodes that were encountered but not yet explored. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search))

We can use a queue to implement BFS.

## BFS: Implementation

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        
class BinarySearchTree:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = None

    def insert(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        if self.root is None:
            self.root = new_node
            return True
        temp = self.root
        while (True):
            if new_node.value == temp.value:
                return False
            if new_node.value < temp.value:
                if temp.left is None:
                    temp.left = new_node
                    return True
                temp = temp.left
            else: 
                if temp.right is None:
                    temp.right = new_node
                    return True
                temp = temp.right

    def contains(self, value):
        if self.root is None:
            return False
        temp = self.root
        while (temp):
            if value < temp.value:
                temp = temp.left
            elif value > temp.value:
                temp = temp.right
            else:
                return True
        return False
  
    def BFS(self):
        current_node = self.root
        queue = []
        results = []
        queue.append(current_node)

        while len(queue) > 0:
            current_node = queue.pop(0)
            results.append(current_node.value)
            if current_node.left is not None:
                queue.append(current_node.left)
            if current_node.right is not None:
                queue.append(current_node.right)
        return results

my_tree = BinarySearchTree()
my_tree.insert(47)
my_tree.insert(21)
my_tree.insert(76)
my_tree.insert(18)
my_tree.insert(27)
my_tree.insert(52)
my_tree.insert(82)
print(my_tree.BFS())
# [47, 21, 76, 18, 27, 52, 82]
```

## DFS: Pre-order

A preordering is a list of the vertices in the order that they were first visited by the depth-first search algorithm. This is a compact and natural way of describing the progress of the search, as was done earlier in this article. A preordering of an expression tree is the expression in Polish notation. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search))

Code:

```python
    def dfs_pre_order(self):
        results = []
        def traverse(current_node):
            results.append(current_node.value)
            if current_node.left is not None:
                traverse(current_node.left)
            if current_node.right is not None:
                traverse(current_node.right)
        traverse(self.root)
        return results

my_tree = BinarySearchTree()
my_tree.insert(47)
my_tree.insert(21)
my_tree.insert(76)
my_tree.insert(18)
my_tree.insert(27)
my_tree.insert(52)
my_tree.insert(82)
print(my_tree.dfs_pre_order())
# [47, 21, 18, 27, 76, 52, 82]
```

## DFS: Post-order

A postordering is a list of the vertices in the order that they were last visited by the depth-first search algorithm. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search))

Code:

```python
    def dfs_post_order(self):
        results = []
        def traverse(current_node):
            if current_node.left is not None:
                traverse(current_node.left)
            if current_node.right is not None:
                traverse(current_node.right)
            results.append(current_node.value)
        traverse(self.root)
        return results


my_tree = BinarySearchTree()
my_tree.insert(47)
my_tree.insert(21)
my_tree.insert(76)
my_tree.insert(18)
my_tree.insert(27)
my_tree.insert(52)
my_tree.insert(82)

print(my_tree.dfs_post_order())

# [18, 27, 21, 52, 82, 76, 47]
```

## DFS: In-order

In-order is a list of the vertices in the order that they were visited by the depth-first search algorithm. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search))

Code:

```python
    def dfs_in_order(self):
        results = []
        def traverse(current_node):
            if current_node.left is not None:
                traverse(current_node.left)
            results.append(current_node.value) 
            if current_node.right is not None:
                traverse(current_node.right)          
        traverse(self.root)
        return results

my_tree = BinarySearchTree()
my_tree.insert(47)
my_tree.insert(21)
my_tree.insert(76)
my_tree.insert(18)
my_tree.insert(27)
my_tree.insert(52)
my_tree.insert(82)
print(my_tree.dfs_in_order())

# [18, 21, 27, 47, 52, 76, 82]
```
