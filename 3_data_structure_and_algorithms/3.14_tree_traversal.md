## Tree Traversal: Introduction

The idea of tree traversal is to visit each node of a tree in a certain order. The order can be pre-order, in-order, or post-order. The time complexity of tree traversal is O(n). The space complexity is O(n). The tree traversal is a recursive algorithm. The base case is when the tree is empty.

## BFS: Introduction

Breadth first search (BFS) is a tree traversal algorithm. It is a variation of tree traversal. It is used to traverse a tree in a level order manner. The time complexity of BFS is O(n). The space complexity is O(n).
