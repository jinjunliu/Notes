## Installing Anaconda or Miniconda

I would recommend installing Anaconda. Go to [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/) to download the latest version. Choose Individual Edition if you are a personal user. Anaconda not only includes Python, but also some commonly used Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, scipy, matplotlib, etc. Also, it includes a powerful tool called `conda` which can be used to manage your Python environment.

I personally prefer installing [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) because it is a mini version of Anaconda, and we can still use `conda` package manager after installing Miniconada.

## conda for environment management

For different projects, you may need to use different Python environments. For example, a project needs Python 3.8, another needs Python 3.9. Different projects may also require different package versions, and these package versions may also depend on Python version. If you only use one Python environment, your Python environment will be very messy.

Therefore, we need to use conda to manage Python environments. We can refer to [conda official documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) for more information.
