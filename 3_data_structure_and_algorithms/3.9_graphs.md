## Graph: Introduction

Graphs are a data structure that can be used to represent a network of nodes (or vertices) and edges (or connections). The edges can be directed or undirected. Each edge has a weight. A real-world example of a graph would be a social network or a digital map. (See [reference](http://mathcenter.oxford.emory.edu/site/cs171/graphs/)). A tree is a special type of graph in which each node is connected to exactly two other nodes. A linked list is a special type of graph in which each node is connected to exactly one other node.

## Graph: Adjacency Matrix and Adjacency List

There are two ways to represent a graph: the one is to use an adjacency matrix. The adjacency matrix is a two-dimensional array of booleans. The value at the i-th row and j-th column is true if there is an edge between the i-th and j-th nodes. The other way to represent a graph is to use an adjacency list. The adjacency list is a list of lists. The value at the i-th index of the adjacency list is a list of the nodes that are connected to the i-th node.

Adjacency matrix of undirected graph is symmetric because if a node A is connected to a node B, then B is also connected to A. The diagonal of the adjacency matrix is always zero because there is no edge between a node and itself.
