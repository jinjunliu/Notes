Well, the udemy course is over at this point, but I think it does not cover all the topics about data structures and algorithms, e.g, the dynamic programming algorithm. I will continue to add more content.

I took the `Introduction to Graduate Algorithms` course from [Georgia Tech](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6515-intro-graduate-algorithms), the lecture is free and available on [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud401).
