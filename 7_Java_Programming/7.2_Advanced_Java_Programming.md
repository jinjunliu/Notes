### Project: Parallel Web Crawler

Here's some info about the project you will complete at the end of the course.

UdaciSearch is interested in figuring out popular search terms on the internet in order to improve the SEO of their clients.

You are given the source code for your company's legacy web crawler, which is single-threaded. You notice it's a bit slow, and you quickly realize a way to improve its performance and impress your new manager.

## Functional Programming in Java

Here are some topics covered in this lesson:

- Comparing and contrasting imperative and functional programming styles, and understanding when one style might be preferrable over the other.
- Using functional interfaces and lambdas to create shorter, easier-to-read Java code.
- Using the Stream API to process data and aggregate the results into Java collections.
