## Hash Tables: Introduction

Hash tables are a data structure that are similar to lists. The difference is that they are not ordered. A simple real-world example of a hash table would be a dictionary. If you put words in a dictionary, you can look up the definition of the word. (See [reference](http://mathcenter.oxford.emory.edu/site/cs171/hashtables/)). Hash tables have method called `insert` and `lookup`.
