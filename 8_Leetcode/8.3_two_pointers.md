## Container With Most Water

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int max_area = 0, area = 0;
        int n = height.length;
        int left = 0, right = n - 1;
        while( left < right) {
            area = Math.min(height[right], height[left]) * (right - left);
            max_area = Math.max(max_area, area);
            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                left ++;
            } else {
                right --;
            }
        }
        return max_area;
    }
}
```

* Two pointers;
* Time complexity: O(n);
