# Introduction

Big O notation is a mathematical notation for describing the complexity of an algorithm. Time and space complexity are two things we care about when it comes to designing algorithms.

# Worst Case

$Omega(n)$ is the best case complexity of an algorithm. $theta(n)$ is the average case complexity of an algorithm. $Omicron(n)$ is the worst case complexity of an algorithm.
