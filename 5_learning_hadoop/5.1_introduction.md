## Using cloud services

Hadoop cluster 3 ways:

* Open source: Apache Hadoop
* Commercial distribution
    - Cloudera, Hortonworks, etc.

    - Iaas - you install/manage (use VM/Docker images)
    - PaaS - vendor provides image and management


Tips for using public cloud to keep the cost low:

* Start small
* Set budget & alerts
* User vendor-optimizations in production
    - AWS - EC2 spot instances
    - GCP - GCS preemptible instances
