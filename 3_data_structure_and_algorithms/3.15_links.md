Well, the udemy course is over at this point, but I think it does not cover all the topics about data structures and algorithms, e.g, the dynamic programming algorithm. I will continue to add more content.

## Introduction to Graduate Algorithms

I took the `Introduction to Graduate Algorithms` course by [Georgia Tech](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6515-intro-graduate-algorithms), the lecture is free and available on [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud401). Some resources related to the course are:

* Eric's notes: https://gtalgorithms.wordpress.com/
* A Zhihu article on knapsack problem (in Chinese): https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/93857890
* An open source book on leetcode problems (in Chinese): https://books.halfrost.com/leetcode/
* Open course CS61B `Data Structures` by UC Berkeley: https://sp19.datastructur.es/
